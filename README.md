# SWGEMU-Mods
A small group of mods curated by myself for use on Star Wars Galaxies Emulator (SWGEmu) Infinity Server
and distributed to The Syndicate <-sYn-> guild.

Credit to all original creators, this pack was put together for easy distrobution since a lot of these
mods are older and hard to find (a lot of broken links out there).

## Full list of mods in this pack includes:
- Clear Skies
- Borrie's Better Skies
- Borrie's Better Lightsabers
- SWGEmu New PreCU UI Color Schemes by Kayliaah
- Mute Force Meditate
- Group Window Fix



## Other mods to consider:

    Run setup tool, browse to and select SWGEmu.exe, select DirectX 9 when prompted for a render engine,
    Do not set any profiles, Done.
