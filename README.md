# SWGEMU-Mods
A small group of mods curated by myself for use on Star Wars Galaxies Emulator (SWGEmu) Infinity Server
and distributed to The Syndicate <-sYn-> guild.

Credit to all original creators, this pack was put together for easy distrobution since a lot of these
mods are older and hard to find (a lot of broken links out there).

    * Clear Skies
    * Borrie's Better Skies
    * Borrie's Better Lightsabers
    * SWGEmu New PreCU UI Color Schemes by Kayliaah

    Run setup tool, browse to and select SWGEmu.exe, select DirectX 9 when prompted for a render engine,
